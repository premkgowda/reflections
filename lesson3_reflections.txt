When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
It can be used as back up. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
The changes made may not be logically complete in which case I want to pull my repository manually.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks - are the copy of repositories existing on github servers
Clones - are the copy of repository existing on local machine
branches- version of the code that is different from the master and has it's own commit

Forks-when we want to copy the existing repository and keep track of the changes and tie it back to the original
Clones - when we want to make changes on your local system
branches - to test things out or for experimental stuff and later merge it with master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I guess if you are offline, you can make changes to it.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Difficult to track who did what changes.
Difficult to trace it to the original work and too manual error prone.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

when we like our changes to be reviewed by others.
we don't screw up the master if there is a mistake in the brach
